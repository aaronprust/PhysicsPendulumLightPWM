# PhysicsPendulumLightPWM

This project was created for a laser cut acrylic sculpture using LED lighting.

Pulse Width Modulated LED control based on a physics simulated double pendulum which controls an LED's color.

Runs on an ATtiny (a programmable microcontroller) - it has an RBB LED for output and a push button switch for input that cycles through different modes.
